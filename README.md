# really-bad-dungeon-generator
A dungeon generator that is really bad.

## How to run
- Go into CommandLineGeneration
- Run dungeon.js using node.js
- it should output text in the command line and create a txt file named "data.txt" in the same directory

generator01.js doesn't work well and will probably break if you tried running it.
